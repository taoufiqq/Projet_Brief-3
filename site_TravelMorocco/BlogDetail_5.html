        		<p class="parag">Packing the right things for summer travel in Morocco can make all the difference in your vacation enjoyment. Read on for some helpful information to keep in mind when making your packing list!</p>
        		<h1 class="h" style="color: #0066FF">Packing List For Summer Travel in Morocco</h1>
        		<p class="parag">When planning your Moroccan dream vacation, you need to decide on many things. From what time of year you are going to how much money you’ll have to spend when you get there, you have much to work out. And if you are heading to North Africa in the Summer, you’ll want to be very aware of the temperatures. Some parts of Morocco get very hot in the Summer. Yet there are times when you may find it surprisingly cool – enough so you might like to have a sweater handy. So what should you pack when planning for Summer travel in Morocco?

                And what should you pack?</p>
                <h1 class="h">Advantages of a Winter Vacation in Morocco</h1>
                <p class="parag">There are some great reasons why Summer is a wonderful time to visit Morocco. For one thing, if you are traveling with kids, their long break from school provides a lot of freedom for a longer vacation. And traveling during the busy season also means that more activities are available since there is more demand for them. And although transportation and lodging can be more expensive during the busy season, you can avoid a lot of that by booking well in advance. 

                Summer is a wonderful time for exploring the beach, and the mountains. If you love to surf or dream of spending hours soaking up the sun by the pool, summer is a great time to do it. And even on the hottest days, once the sun sets, the evenings cool off quite nicely. So if you are a bit of a night owl, you will love Summer nights in Morocco.

                You will definitely want to keep those Summer temperatures in mind when you make your travel plans. Temperatures can range from balmy to oppressive from place to place, so keep that in mind when planning for Summer travel in Morocco.

                <h1 class="h">Pack to Dress in Layers</h1>
                <p class="parag">The temperatures in Morocco are as varied as the geography itself. From beaches to deserts to mountains, temperatures can range from very hot to rather chilly, all on the same day. Therefore, when making your packing list, think about layers and variety. Make sure you have plenty of items made with loose-fitting breathable fabric like cotton so you can stay cool while staying covered. Think of shirts that go together, yet can be worn alone. And make sure you have at least a couple of warmer items on hand, just in case you need them. With plenty of variety, your Summer travel in Morocco will be a lot more pleasant.</p>
                <h1 class="h">Pack According to Your Summer Travel Plans</h1>
                <p class="parag">When building your Summer packing list for Morocco, think about the places you will be visiting and the activities you dream of doing.

                In Summer, another important consideration is to remember that you are visiting a Muslim country. Morocco welcomes many visitors from all around the world and in areas with heavy tourist traffic, dress code is not so important. However, even in the busiest city souk, you may experience unwanted and even negative attention if you dress too inappropriately.
